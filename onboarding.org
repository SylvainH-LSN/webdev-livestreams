* Onboarding
** Setup
*** Downloading a text editor
I strongly recommend Visual Studio Code : [[https://code.visualstudio.com/][https://code.visualstudio.com/]]

Reasons : Easy for beginners, Open source, a lot of extensions,
mainstream, nice UI/UX, remote editing, ...

Download the installer of your choice, and go through the installation

Open a CLI and type in : code --version

*** Downloading Git
On Windows10 : https://git-scm.com/download/win
Download the installer, and execute it.

*** Downloading the project
- ~git clone <url>~ (use the HTTPS URL by default (or the SSH if you
  configured it)

*** First modifications
**** Observe the repository state
- ~git status~ : see the differences between the commit you point to
  and the current state of the folder.
- ~git log~ : See the commit history of the current branch. Note : the
  ~--oneline~ flag gives a shorter description per commit.

**** Commit modifications and share them to workmates
- ~git remote add <name> <url>~ : Adds a remote repository.
  Usually, we use ~origin~ for one's own fork, and ~upstream~ for the
  official repository.
- ~git add .~ : Add files in the "staging area" (preparation area)
  before commiting (archiving) the modified/added/deleted files.
- ~git commit -m "Updated this file : file.txt"~ : Commit (archive the
  delta modifications) in your local machine
- ~git push <name>~ : Push your modifications on the remote
  server. ~<name>~ refers to the remote repository name you want to push
  to (for example origin or upstream).
- ~git pull <name> <branch>~ : Pulling changes from a remote repository")

*** Download Nodejs

Link : https://nodejs.org/en/download/
(Let every default as is)

And voil√†, you are ready to play !
